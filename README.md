# Data Science Projects

### Project 1
## [From Stray to Stay: Predicting Adoption for Shelter Cats](https://github.com/sun712k/animal-shelter.git)

This project conducts Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on animal shelter data to create a binary classification model predicting cat adoption. By identifying factors influencing adoption, it aims to improve care and support for animals. The final voting classifier model achieved a 77% accuracy and 81% F1 score for adoption prediction.

### Project 2
## [Integrated Health Assessment: Predicting Heart Disease and Diabetes with CDC Data](https://github.com/sun712k/chronic-disease.git)

This project seeks to predict both heart disease and diabetes, filling a gap in existing models focused on individual diseases. Utilizing the 2022 CDC survey data from 400,000+ adults, it uncovers insights on physical status, regional health disparities, and correlations with chronic diseases. This project includes the development of a user-friendly website for predictions.

### Project 3
## [Purrfect Identification: Image Classification for Recognizing My Cat and other Cats](https://github.com/sun712k/cat-recognition.git)

The project aims to build an image classifier to distinguish between cat images from various breeds and personal photos of my cat, Mellow. Using transfer learning to boost performance due to limited data, the model achieved 100% training accuracy and 95% validation accuracy.
