# Data Science Portfolio Projects

### Project 1
## [From Stray to Stay: Predicting Adoption for Shelter Cats](https://github.com/sun712k/animal-shelter.git)

This project conducts Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on animal shelter data to create a binary classification model predicting cat adoption. By identifying factors influencing adoption, it aims to improve care and support for animals. The final voting classifier model achieved a 77% accuracy and 81% F1 score for adoption prediction.

### Project 2
## [Integrated Health Assessment: Predicting Heart Disease and Diabetes with CDC Data](https://github.com/sun712k/chronic-disease.git)
[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sun712k/portfolio/main/images/disease-image.jpeg" alt="Image" width="500" >](https://github.com/sun712k/chronic-disease.git)

This project seeks to predict both heart disease and diabetes, filling a gap in existing models focused on individual diseases. Utilizing the 2022 CDC survey data from 400,000+ adults, it uncovers insights on physical status, regional health disparities, and correlations with chronic diseases. This project includes the development of a user-friendly website for predictions. [more](https://github.com/sun712k/chronic-disease.git)

### Project 3
## [Purrfect Cat Image Recognition: Classification for My Cat and other Cats](https://github.com/sun712k/cat-image-recognition.git)
[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sun712k/portfolio/main/images/mellow%20face_recognized.jpg" alt="Image" width="500">](https://github.com/sun712k/cat-image-recognition.git)

The project aims to build an image classifier to distinguish between cat images from various breeds and personal photos of my cat, Mellow. Using transfer learning to boost performance due to limited data, the model achieved 100% training accuracy and 95% validation accuracy. [more](https://github.com/sun712k/cat-image-recognition.git)

### Project 4
## [Cat Vocalizations Clustering: Exploring the Diversity of Cat Meows](https://github.com/sun712k/cat-vocalization-clustering.git)
[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sun712k/portfolio/main/images/mellow_meowing.jpg" alt="Image" width="500">](https://github.com/sun712k/cat-vocalization-clustering.git)

The main aim of this project is to identify distinct vocalizations made by the user's cat, particularly focusing on meow sounds. Utilizing audio feature extraction and PCA, three clustering methods were employed for unsupervised learning. The final voting clustering process identified 11 distinct sounds unanimously agreed upon by all methods. [more](https://github.com/sun712k/cat-vocalization-clustering.git)
