This project investigates whether high-altitude environments are a causal driver of elite endurance running performance using Olympic marathon data. It utilizes both between-country and within-country analyses to distinguish physiological effects of altitude from cultural and socioeconomic factors.

### Project 2
## [Cancer Incidence & Survival: Tableau Dashboard](https://github.com/sun712k/Cancer-Data-Analysis-Tableau){:target="_blank"}
[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sun712k/portfolio/main/assets/img/cancer_dashboard.png" alt="Image" width="500">](https://github.com/sun712k/Cancer-Data-Analysis-Tableau){:target="_blank"}

This project analyzes U.S. cancer incidence, mortality, and survival data to build an interactive Tableau dashboard inspired by Cancer Facts & Figures 2025. By examining geographic patterns, mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIR), and healthcare system performance, it highlights disparities and progress across states, cancer types, and sexes. The dashboard translates complex public health statistics into accessible, exploratory insights for researchers, policymakers, and the public.

### Project 3
## [Chronic Disease Prediction: Streamlit App](https://github.com/sun712k/chronic-disease.git){:target="_blank"}
[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sun712k/portfolio/main/assets/img/chronic_disease.png" alt="Image" width="500" >](https://github.com/sun712k/chronic-disease.git){:target="_blank"}

This project seeks to predict both heart disease and diabetes, filling a gap in existing models focused on individual diseases. Utilizing the 2022 CDC survey data from 400,000+ adults, it uncovers insights on physical status, regional health disparities, and correlations with chronic diseases. This project includes the development of a user-friendly website for predictions. [more](https://github.com/sun712k/chronic-disease.git){:target="_blank"}


### Project 4
## [Unsupervised Audio Clustering: Exploring the Diversity of Cat Meows](https://github.com/sun712k/cat-vocalization-clustering.git){:target="_blank"}

The main aim of this project is to identify distinct vocalizations made by my cat, particularly focusing on meow sounds. Utilizing audio feature extraction and PCA, three clustering methods were employed for unsupervised learning. The final voting clustering process identified 11 distinct sounds unanimously agreed upon by all methods. [more](https://github.com/sun712k/cat-vocalization-clustering.git){:target="_blank"}


### Project 5
## [Image Classification: Distinguishing Specific Felines via Transfer Learning](https://github.com/sun712k/cat-image-recognition.git){:target="_blank"}
[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sun712k/portfolio/main/assets/img/mellow%20face_recognized.jpg" alt="Image" width="500">](https://github.com/sun712k/cat-image-recognition.git){:target="_blank"}

The project aims to build an image classifier to distinguish between cat images from various breeds and personal photos of my cat, Mellow. Using transfer learning to boost performance due to limited data, the model achieved 100% training accuracy and 95% validation accuracy. [more](https://github.com/sun712k/cat-image-recognition.git)


### Project 6
## [Predictive Analytics for Animal Care: Factors Influencing Shelter Cat Adoption](https://github.com/sun712k/animal-shelter.git){:target="_blank"}
[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sun712k/portfolio/main/assets/img/mellow_shelter.jpg" alt="Image" width="500" >](https://github.com/sun712k/animal-shelter.git){:target="_blank"}

This project conducts Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on animal shelter data to create a binary classification model predicting cat adoption. By identifying factors influencing adoption, it aims to improve care and support for animals. The final voting classifier model achieved a 77% accuracy and 81% F1 score for adoption prediction.
